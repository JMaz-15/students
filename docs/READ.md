## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 

I believe I deserve around 16/20 on this assignment. I got stuck on the start game button event handler. Whenever I would clikc the button the game screen would flash then instantly take me back to the username entering. Because the screen wouldn't show, the assignment checks didn't pass. However, I did pass every test using the "npm test" command so I believe i deserve at least an 80%. I added code in the index.js that I believe is correct, but couldn't test it due to the fact I couldn't get the game screen to show.  
## Self-Reflection:

I worked hard on this assignment and I hope my code can show this. I haven't ever taken a game development class and I haven't taken web dev in 2 years so I am going to struggle on some labs. I hope I have enough in here to recieve a good grade. 

### How long it took me to finish this?
This took me around 6 hours.
